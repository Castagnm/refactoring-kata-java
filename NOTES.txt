started at around 2:45 pm.
Expected end : 4:15 pm.

Goal : refactor the ShoppingController class.

Initial observations : 
environment is maven, spring, springboot. The ShoppingController, once started, exposes a POST route.
Ideally, we could test it with POSTMAN. It might be a bit too much, especially considering a test is already in place.

1st step : *understand the test*. Add comments to explain the business logic. Read through. Test. Confirm expected behavior.
2nd step : if it works, at first clean up the code. Rename variables. break down methods. Create classes. Keep it to simple corrections. See if some simple tests can be added.
3rd step : once the code is readable, it can be more easily optimized - with specific methods, tools, algorithms...

writing tests immediatly might sound tempting, but it is still a bit hard to understand the general business logic - I prefer to clean up at first what's rather simple to do.
Body and Item are data structures and thus added to a data folder.
Their setters are also removed and their attributes fixed to final : the method of shoppingcontroller only read this data.

the logger will be removed for now. We can always add it afterwards, once the code is easier to understand, so that we may log business or technical information.
